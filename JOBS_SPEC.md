JOBS_SPEC.md – Job Model & Execution (v1.1.1)
id: jobs.v1.1.1
status: normative
owner: core/simulation
last_updated: 2025-09-30

0) Scope

Defines the job model, APIs and execution pipeline for simulation work initiated by player Orders or systems. The initial vertical slice implements Haul jobs (pickup → deliver) on top of Navigation and UPDATE_ORDER. This version documents the v1.1.1 transition to Diff‑Log writes for hauling and cross‑Z destination selection, and clarifies filters to prevent infinite shuttling.

1) Principles

- Deterministic outputs: stable iteration and sorting keys; seeded pathfinding per job; identical results across OS/CPU/threads.
- Read‑parallel planning, single‑writer commit: plan jobs in parallel across chunks; merge/apply via a single writer per chunk (v1.1.1 uses global write; v2 migrates to chunk‑parallel merge with per‑chunk single writer). No data races.
- Data‑driven and budgeted: priorities, limits, and heuristics from registries; per‑tick budgets; graceful back‑pressure.
- Failure‑safe: job failures never crash the loop; reservations and queues unwind cleanly.

2) Terms

- Designation: player intent (e.g., Orders → Haul rectangle) stored in OrdersManager.
- TaskTicket (Plan artifact): minimal DTO describing work to do (e.g., move item A → cell B at Z).
- ActiveJob (Exec artifact): runtime state for a job assigned to an agent, with stage machine and transient state.
- Planner: Read phase system producing TaskTickets (never mutates world).
- Executor: Write phase system that assigns agents and advances ActiveJobs; mutations go through Diff‑Log (v1.1.1) or controlled managers.

3) Flow per Tick (summary)

```
ApplyCommands  ->  (OrdersManager receives designations)
      ↓
Read Phase --------------------------------------------------------------
  HaulingSystem.ReadTick(t)
    - Drain new designations (bounded) + include active designations
    - For each rect: enumerate candidate items
        skip: reserved, carried, already-in-stockpile
    - Choose destination cell (stockpile shard; cross‑Z allowed)
    - Enqueue PlannedMove DTOs (stable order)
  [barrier]
Write Phase -------------------------------------------------------------
  HaulJobSystem (t)
    - Drain planned moves + backlog
    - Assign agents (HP>0, not busy, deterministic; cross‑Z allowed)
    - On assignment: reserve item (temporary object‑local)
    - Advance: ToItem → MarkCarried → ToDest → MoveItem+UnmarkCarried → Complete
    - Emit DiffOps: MoveCreature / MarkCarried / MoveItem / UnmarkCarried
  DiffLog
    - Merge+Sort by stable key; apply in deterministic order
```

4) APIs (current)

- OrdersManager (thread‑safe ingress)
  - `void EnqueueHaul(Rectangle worldRect, int z, int priority, ulong tick)`
  - `int DrainHaulDesignations(ICollection<HaulDesignation> into, int maxCount)`
  - `List<HaulDesignation> GetActiveHaulsSnapshot()`

- HaulingSystem (planner)
  - `void ReadTick(ulong tick)`
    - drains designations; enumerates items; `TryFindDestination(ItemInstance, zones, out Point destWorld, out int destZ)`
    - enqueues `PlannedMove { Guid ItemGuid; Point From; int FromZ; Point To; int ToZ; }`
  - `void WriteTick(ulong tick)` → hands planned moves to executor inbox
  - `int DequeuePlannedMoves(int max, IList<PlannedMove> into)`

- HaulJobSystem (executor)
  - `void ReadTick(ulong tick)`
    - drains backlog + planned; assigns workers deterministically
  - `void WriteTick(ulong tick)`
    - MovementExecutor.UpdateMovement; emits DiffOps (see §6)

- Navigation
  - `Path PathService.Solve(in PathRequest request, in IWorldNavigationView world)`
  - `void MovementExecutor.BeginMovement(uint entity, PathRequest, Path)`
  - `MovementUpdate MovementExecutor.UpdateMovement(uint entity, IWorldNavigationView world)`

5) Writes, Threads & Diff‑Log

- v1 (prototype): global serial write; direct manager writes.
- v1.1.1 (current): global serial write; hauling emits DiffOps:
  - Items/L5: `MoveItem`, `MarkCarried`, `UnmarkCarried` (Reserve/Release coming with ReservationManager)
  - Creatures/L6: `MoveCreature`
  - DiffLog.MergeAndSort() applies ops; runtime state updated by applicators.
- v2 (target): Read parallel per chunk; Write per‑chunk single writer MergeApply in parallel; cross‑chunk commit order = ascending ChunkId.

6) Haul Job details (v1.1.1)

6.1 Filters & anti‑ping‑pong
- Planner skips items that are:
  - reserved or carried; or
  - currently placed on any stockpile cell (prevents infinite re‑hauling between zones).

6.2 Reservations & carry
- On assignment: temporary object‑local reservation (`item.IsReserved=true; ReservedBy=worker`).
- On pickup: emit `MarkCarried(itemGuid, workerGuid)`.
- On place: emit `MoveItem(itemGuid→destCell)` and `UnmarkCarried(itemGuid)`; `ReleaseReservation` will be added with ReservationManager.

6.3 Executor state machine
- `AssignWorker`: filter HP>0, not busy; deterministic order; cross‑Z allowed.
- `AdvanceJob`: UpdateMovement → ToItem (Arrived: MarkCarried, path to dest) → ToDest (Arrived: MoveItem, UnmarkCarried) → Complete.

6.4 Diff operations
- Items/L5: `MoveItem`, `MarkCarried`, `UnmarkCarried`.
- Creatures/L6: `MoveCreature`.

7) Budgets & Back‑pressure
- Planner: `max_designations_per_tick`, `max_planned_moves_per_tick`.
- Executor: `max_jobs_started_per_tick`; Movement pacing.
- Backlog: planned moves not assigned go to retry queue; deterministic order preserved.

8) Error Handling & Determinism
- `NoPath`: try next worker; else backlog; counters tracked.
- `NeedsReplan`: topology change leads to deterministic replans.
- `ItemMissing` / reserved / carried: drop ticket; planner skips on subsequent scans.
- `AlreadyInStockpile`: skipped by planner.

9) Telemetry & UI (v1.2)
- Work Drawer counters: Assigned/Completed/NoPath/Requeued.
- Active jobs list (future): JobId, Worker, Stage, From→Dest, ETA, Retries, FailReason.

10) Migration Roadmap (v1 → v1.1.1 → v2)
- v1: prototype end‑to‑end; direct writes.
- v1.1.1: Diff‑Log for hauling; cross‑Z destinations; diagonal moves per tuning; planner filter for stockpiled items; counters.
- v2: ReservationManager via Diff; StockpileManager as authority source for planner; per‑chunk MergeApply parallel write; read‑parallel planners.

11) Determinism guarantees
- Stable iteration/sort; seeded pathfinding: `SeedFrom(workerGuid,itemGuid)`.
- Fixed write order (global serial now; chunk‑serial later with fixed cross‑chunk commit order).
- Applicators perform conflict‑free merges based on stable keys.

12) Workshops & Roles (future)
- Add data‑driven Workshops/Spots (e.g., Mining Workshop, Hauling Spot, Lumber Workshop, Farming Workshop) that advertise supported job kinds and capacity.
- Introduce Role/Roster manager mapping workers to roles and assigned workshops.
- Executors filter candidate workers by role/workshop eligibility before assignment; deterministic ordering preserved.
- Workshops may provide local bonuses (speed/quality) and shifts; performance gains by shrinking candidate sets; UPDATE_ORDER and Diff model remain unchanged.
